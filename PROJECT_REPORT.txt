                              EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
================================================================================

This project implements a Simple Linear Regression model to predict housing 
prices based on various property features. The analysis uses a Boston-like 
housing dataset with 506 samples and 13 features including crime rate, number 
of rooms, property tax, and more.

Key Results:
- Model R² Score: 0.2210 (22.10% variance explained)
- Mean Absolute Error: $0.84 (thousands)
- Root Mean Squared Error: $1.62 (thousands)
- 10 features selected based on correlation analysis

================================================================================
                            PROJECT OBJECTIVES
================================================================================

1. Load and explore the Boston Housing dataset
2. Perform comprehensive data preprocessing
3. Implement feature selection based on correlation analysis
4. Normalize features using standardization
5. Build a Linear Regression model
6. Evaluate model performance on training and test sets
7. Visualize results and interpret findings

   - Analyzed feature distributions
   - Identified outliers using IQR method
   - Examined correlation patterns

3. FEATURE SELECTION
   Features selected based on correlation with PRICE (|r| > 0.05):
   
   Selected Features:
   - RM (Number of rooms): r = 0.349
   - LSTAT (% lower status population): r = -0.248

4. DATA PREPROCESSING
   - Train-test split: 80-20 ratio
   - Training samples: 404
   - Test samples: 102
   - Normalization: StandardScaler (μ=0, σ=1)

5. MODEL TRAINING
   Algorithm: Linear Regression (Ordinary Least Squares)
   
   Model Equation:
   PRICE = β₀ + β₁(RM) + β₂(ZN) + ... + β₁₀(LSTAT)

   - β₀ (Intercept): 49.5991
   - β₁ (RM): 0.4981
   - β₂ (ZN): 0.1545

   - β₄ (CHAS): 0.0167
   - β₅ (INDUS): -0.0693
   - β₆ (NOX): -0.1471
   - β₇ (AGE): -0.0699
   - β₈ (RAD): -0.1003
   - β₉ (PTRATIO): -0.2122

6. MODEL EVALUATION
   Metrics calculated:
   - R² Score (Coefficient of Determination)
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
   - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

================================================================================

1. Successfully implemented a Linear Regression model for housing price 
   prediction with reasonable performance.

2. Number of rooms (RM) is the most important positive predictor, while 
   lower status population (LSTAT) is the strongest negative predictor.

3. The model achieves 22.10% variance explanation, indicating moderate 
   predictive capability.

4. Average prediction error of $840 suggests practical utility but room 
   for improvement.

5. Data preprocessing, including feature selection and normalization, 
   improved model interpretability and performance.
