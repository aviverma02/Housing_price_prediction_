## 🎯 Project Overview

This project implements a **Simple Linear Regression model** to predict housing prices based on various property features using the Boston Housing dataset. It includes comprehensive data preprocessing, feature selection, normalization, and model evaluation.  

## 📋 Task Description

- **Use** a housing prices dataset (Boston Housing dataset)
- **Perform** data preprocessing, including feature selection and normalization
- **Build** a linear regression model to predict house prices based on features like:
  - Number of rooms
  - Square footage 
  - Crime rate
  - Property tax
  - And more...

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

### Running the Project

```bash
python housing_price_prediction.py
```

### Expected Output

The script will:
1. ✅ Load the housing dataset
2. ✅ Perform exploratory data analysis
3. ✅ Select relevant features
4. ✅ Preprocess and normalize data
5. ✅ Train a Linear Regression model
6. ✅ Evaluate performance
7. ✅ Generate visualizations
8. ✅ Save results

## 📊 Key Results

| Metric | Training Set | Test Set |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **R² Score** | 0.2440 | 0.2210 |
| **RMSE** | 1.3008 | 1.6196 |
| **MAE** | 0.7968 | 0.8414 |

## 🔍 Features Used

The model uses 10 carefully selected features:

1. **RM** - Average number of rooms per dwelling
2. **LSTAT** - % lower status of the population
3. **PTRATIO** - Pupil-teacher ratio
4. **RAD** - Index of accessibility to highways
5. **AGE** - Proportion of owner-occupied units built before 1940
6. **NOX** - Nitric oxides concentration
7. **INDUS** - Proportion of non-retail business acres
8. **ZN** - Proportion of residential land zoned
9. **DIS** - Distances to employment centers
10. **CHAS** - Charles River dummy variable

## 📈 Visualizations

The project generates 9 comprehensive visualizations:

1. 🔥 **Correlation Heatmap** - Feature relationships
2. 📊 **Price Distribution** - Target variable analysis
3. 📍 **Actual vs Predicted (Training)** - Model fit
4. 📍 **Actual vs Predicted (Test)** - Generalization
5. 📉 **Residual Plot (Training)** - Error patterns
6. 📉 **Residual Plot (Test)** - Error validation

## 💡 Key Insights

### Positive Predictors (↑ Price)
- 🏠 **Number of rooms** (+0.498)
- 🌳 **Residential zoning** (+0.155)
- 🚗 **Distance to employment** (+0.156)

### Negative Predictors (↓ Price)
- 👥 **Lower status population** (-0.350)
- 🎓 **Pupil-teacher ratio** (-0.212)
- 🚦 **Highway accessibility** (-0.100)

## 📝 Code Walkthrough

```python
# Step 1: Load Data
df = pd.DataFrame(...)  # Housing dataset

# Step 2: Feature Selection
correlation = df.corr()['PRICE']
selected_features = correlation[abs(correlation) > 0.05]

# Step 3: Train-Test Split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

# Step 4: Normalization
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)

# Step 5: Model Training
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)

# Step 6: Evaluation
y_pred = model.predict(X_test_scaled)
r2 = r2_score(y_test, y_pred)
```
